# Physics-Portfolio
Physics major at UMass Lowell focusing on astrophysics, optical imaging, and radiation systems. Interested in electro-optical sensing, imaging technology, and defense/aerospace applications.

Blackbody Radiation Measurement
Built a radiation detection system using thermistors, thermopiles, and Arduino circuits. Measured emission intensity vs. temperature and analyzed detector response.
Skills: Sensor calibration, signal amplification, thermal radiation analysis

Telescope Imaging & Spectral Analysis
Captured and processed telescope images using diffraction gratings to analyze stellar spectra. Determined temperature and composition from optical data.
Skills: Optical imaging, diffraction analysis, signal processing

NASA Chandra X-Ray Data Analysis
Used CIAO software to calibrate, filter, and analyze X-ray datasets. Performed imaging and spectral fitting on astrophysical sources.
Skills: Detector data analysis, imaging pipelines, high-energy astrophysics
